# Adaptive Virtual Team Planning and Coordination

This repository contains source code, benchmark problem sets, and solutions from my research paper entitled [Adaptive Virtual Team Planning and 
Coordination: A Mathematical Programming Approach](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jm2-03-2024-0070/full/html). The main code 
is written in Python 3, and the MIP model is implemented using OPL and used with the CPLEX solver. You will need both of these installed to be 
able to use this code and run the experiments. This repository is organized as follows:

1. Core Source Code

The core source code is found in the "src" folder. This contains all core data generation and experiment running infrastructure. 

2. Mathematical Optimization Model

The MIP model is implemented using OPL and is found under the "models" folder.

3. Computational Experiments and Results

The experimental data used in the paper (both initial and updated problem versions) as well as the results can be found under the "experiments" folder.
